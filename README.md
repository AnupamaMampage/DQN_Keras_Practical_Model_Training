A multi-step DQN algorithm implementation using Keras, for training the agent using a practical VM cluster set up. The testbed is composed of a kubernetes cluster on which the Kubeless serverless framework is deployed. Prometheus monitoring tool is installed on the control plane for recording cluster metrics. 
The DQN agent is integrated with the Kubernetes APIs in order to derive state/reward metrics real time. The Jmeter load generation tool is used to generate requests for the deployed funcions. This data is used for training the model online.
