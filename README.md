A multi-step DQN algorithm implementation using Keras, for scheduling serverless functions. The agent is trained using a practical VM cluster set up. The testbed is composed of a kubernetes cluster on which the Kubeless serverless framework is deployed. Prometheus monitoring tool is installed on the control plane for recording cluster metrics. The DRL agent replaces the Kubernetes pod scheduler and is integrated with the Kubernetes watch APIs in order to derive state/reward metrics real time for each time step. A time step is identified as each scheduling step of a function pod. The Jmeter load generation tool is used to generate requests for the deployed funcions. This data is used for training the model online.
